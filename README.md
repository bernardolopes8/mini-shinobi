# Bugs

Currently the game only runs at a resolution of 600*1000, changing the window size may break the game core functionality. 
There are also some collision bugs that will be fixed ASAP.

If you find any other bugs please report them to me.

# Planned improvements

Change messages to appear in-game instead of the console

Fix window resize and collision bugs
